# Stay In Touch
In this project we built the MVP for a social media app called ‚ÄúStay in touch‚Äù that mimicks most of the functionalities of the popular [facebook](https://web.facebook.com/) app. 

The app can be accessed via the link below
[Live Demo](https://salty-lowlands-16667.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

<ul>
    <li>Guest is able to create account/log in.</li>
    <li>Guest can see only ‚ÄúSign in‚Äù and ‚ÄúSign out‚Äù page.</li>
</ul>

As a logged-in user:
<ul>
    <li>A user is able to see all users list.</li>
    <li>A user is able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).</li>
    <li>A user is able to send a friendship invitation.</li>
    <li>A user is able to see a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not a friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page.</li>
    <li>A user is able to see pending friendship invitations sent from other users.</li>
    <li>A user is able to accept or reject friendships invitation.</li>
    <li>A user is able to create new posts (text only).</li>
